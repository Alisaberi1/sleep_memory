Rahim had a dream last night, but he does not remember the details of this dream!

In his dream he had two bags of marbles, each bag containing at least one marble. Also, the number of marbles in the first bag is divisible by a and the number of marbles in the second bag is divisible by b. Rahim also remembers that his two bags are not very heavy and there are x marbles in two bags.

Meanwhile, Rahim sees Tok and tells him the story. Tuck also very quickly counts the number of different dreams that Popeye might have had and tells him the number!
